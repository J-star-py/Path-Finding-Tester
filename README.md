# G.U.I FOR TESTING PATHFINDING ALGORITHMS
This GUI was made to visualize and test different pathfinding algorithms and heuristics.
## FEATURES
### 1. Click-and-drag drawing grid:
A square can be filled by clicking and dragging on the grid. The start square is colored in green, the end square is colored in red, and the obstacles / walls are colored in dark gray. To erase a square, you can click and drag over a filled square. ...
### 2. Slider to change grid dimensions:
The slider goes from 19 to 119. You cna only choose odd numbers.
### 3. "Clear grid" button:
Clears all the squares in the grid, getting them to their initial empty state.
### 4. "Play"/"Stop" button:
After the start and end squares are placed, pressing the "play" button will run the pathfinding algorithm and the user won't be able to interact with the grid. By pressing the "stop" button the user will be able to interact with the grid again, and the explored squares and the path found by the algorithm will be cleared from the grid, leaving only the obstacles and the start and end squares.
### 5. Speed control button:
This button controls the speed of the visualization of the algorithm. It has 3 speeds: x2, x4, x8.
